# hyper-arc-dark-controls
Arc-themed window controls for [hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper)

A plugin that makes the close, minimize, and maximize buttons look like the [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) Dark window controls, replacing the standard Windows 10-themed window controls. This plugin has been thoroughly tested in Ubuntu and Windows 10, and works with both `v1.4.8` (old stable) and `v2.0.0` canary and stable versions.

Based on the original [Arc theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) source, this plugin aims to match the theme as much as possible. You're ~welcome~ encouraged to fork this project and modify it if you need to tinker with the colors, or create a PR if I missed something that needs fixing.

### Note

This plugin is designed to work perfectly with the `hyperterm-atom-dark`-theme.
While it also integrates fine with vanilla-themed hyper, I cannot take every theme and plugin into account.
If the plugin doesn't look great on `xyz`-theme, then please do create an issue and I will look into it. But since I don't own a Mac, I cannot test the plugin on every OS, although it's been tested on Linux and Windows 10 which is what I have available.


### Changelog
**1.2.0**
- Added `$arcDarkConfig` variables for better configurability
- Added support for `showWindowControls`
- Optimized code for hyper v2.x

**1.1.8**
- Fixed positioning of the window controls when tabs are active
- Fixed tabs width while using flexbox

**1.1.7**
- Fixed wrong window controls offset on default theme
- Reworked flexbox for better positioning, meaning less `position: absolute`
- Adjusted width and height on both the `<li>`'s and the `svg` icons to match the Arc Dark theme

**1.1.6**
- Fixed hamburgerMenuLeft position issue

**1.1.4, 1.1.5**
- Adjusted the header hight to match the theme
- Applied background color to the header to match the theme color
- Adjusted some values to make the right areas show the background color
- Adjusted the font and font-size of the window title

**1.1.3**
- Applied a small fix to the close button after a hyper update skewered its position.
- Also made the close button smaller to better mimic the original close button.

**1.1.2**
- Small fix to adjust the height and width of the `li` with the maximize and minimize icons, to compensate for the added border.

**1.1.1**
- Small, unmentionable fixes regarding this README.

**1.1.0**
- Converted the originally forked `div` with `span`'s into an `ul` with inline `svg`'s residing inside its `li`'s. This allows for better control over the hover/active functions, and better control over the `fill`-property of the `svg`'s. While using `li`'s we also get past the ugliness of positioning each icon with `position: absolute`, and we now control the space between icons with margin instead. And we now also have the correct hover/active behaviour, since we now have the `background`-property on the `li`'s available aswell.
- The `svg`'s used are taking directly from the original [Arc Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) repository. So all credit goes to [horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180). However, I've optimized them quite a bit by removing empty groups and useless InkScape/SodiPodi tags. It might even be worth a PR.
- By inlining the `svg`'s, we can also get rid of the `/icons` folder aswell, as there's now no need for shipping the actual icons.

**1.0.0**
- Initial release

### Install

**Hyper store**
```
hyper i hyper-arc-dark-controls
```

**Manually**:

1. Open hyper's preferences with `Ctrl+,` (or manually at `~/.hyper.js`) with your editor.
2. Update your list of plugins to include hyper-arc-dark-controls, like so:

        plugins: [
            'hyper-arc-dark-controls'
        ],

3. Reload (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) or restart hyper and voila!

**hpm (1.4.8)**:

1. Install using `hpm i hyper-arc-dark-controls`
2. Reload (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) or restart hyper and voila!

### Configuration

You can configure the window controls like you would in your `~/.hyper.js`.

- `showWindowControls: true` - default, will display the window controls to the right.
- `showWindowControls: 'left'` - will display the window controls to the left in reverse order, like on a Mac.
- `showWindowControls: false` - will disable the window controls, and only theme the header.


### To Do
- Config for lighter Arc themes.
- Create a check to see if the window is focused, and add a class if not, so the window controls will be "faded" like on real window controls.
